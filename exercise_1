The program will create a process at the line "i=fork()". At that point, the actual program and a child process will exist.
Then two new child processes will be spawned at the first line of the if statement. However, none of them will enter the if statement,
because for every child process, fork() returns 0. Instead, the main process and the first created child will enter the if statement and create
two more processes.

Therefore, 6 processes will exist.
